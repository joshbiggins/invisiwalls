# Invisiwalls
This is a sample Unity project that includes a solution for dynamic transparency of walls and other objects.
Any object that is marked as being transparent will have its base material's opacity reduced if it intersects between the camera and the player object.

# How to Use
In the "Test" scene, move your player character around with WASD or the arrow keys to see the transparency effect in action.
To add a transparency effect to a new object, add the "Transparency Wall Controller" script to it, then adjust the In/Out Trans Time parameters to change how long the effect takes.
